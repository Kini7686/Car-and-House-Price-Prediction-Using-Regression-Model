# Car and House Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project is a web application designed for buying and analyzing leveraged cars and houses. The application integrates three regression models to predict the price of houses and cars based on various input features. The models used are:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**

The project was developed to help users make informed decisions when buying leveraged cars and houses by providing accurate price predictions based on historical data.

## Key Features
- **Web Application:** Allows users to input features of cars and houses to receive price predictions.
- **Three Regression Models:** Implements Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ridge Regression to compare prediction accuracy.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved an R² score of **0.92** for house price prediction and **0.95** for car price prediction, showcasing the model's precision.
- **Visualization Tools:** Displays prediction results and comparison between different models.

## Achievements
- **Innovation 2022 Project Competition:** Secured **2nd place** with the project demonstrating high predictive accuracy for both car and house prices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Flask (for the web application)
- scikit-learn (for the regression models)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Numpy (for numerical operations)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kini7686/car-house-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd car-house-price-prediction
   ```
2. Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to start using the web application.

### Input Features
For **Car Price Prediction**:
- Year of Manufacture
- Mileage
- Engine Size
- Make
- Model
- Fuel Type
- Transmission Type

For **House Price Prediction**:
- Location
- Size (sq ft)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Year Built
- Amenities

## Results
- **Car Price Prediction:** R² score of **0.95**
- **House Price Prediction:** R² score of **0.92**

Both models achieved high accuracy, making them reliable for predicting prices in real-world scenarios.
